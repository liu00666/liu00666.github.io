            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a UI/UX Designer based in <em >Ottawa, <abbr title="Ontario">ON</abbr></em>. I use design to explore, understand, and engage with the world. I'm passionate about creating better experiences to help people live an easier life.</p>
            <p>Beyond the realm of design, I find joy in venturing out into the world to capture its beauty and weirdness. In my creative pursuits, you might catch me crafting posters or illustrating pasta using markers. On quieter days, you'll find me doing yoga in the park</p>
